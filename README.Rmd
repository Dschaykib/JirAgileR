[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matbmeijer/JirAgileR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matbmeijer/JirAgileR) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/b3fole2aw1qsw2x9?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/matbmeijer/jiragiler)


## Objective

The objective of **JirAgileR** is to bring the power of the project management tool **JIRA** to **R**. By doing so, users benefit from the best capabilities of both platforms. More specifically, the package is a wrapper around [JIRA's REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/rest-apis/), allowing users to analyze proyects or issues from JIRA in R. The underlying powertrain of the API is the *__Jira Query Language__ (JQL)*. You can find more information about it [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracore/blog/2015/07/search-jira-like-a-boss-with-jql). All used functions return as a result a `data.frame`.


### `r Sys.Date()` Functionalities

1. Extract all projects with its basic information (e.g. Name, ID, Key, Type, Category etc.)
2. Extract all issues spefic to user defined JIRA query (it allows to expand both JIRA's default fields as well as user defined custom JIRA fields)
3. Extract comments and comments details from JIRA issues.

### Roadmap

1. Define an integrated class within the package
2. Include *pipes* to facilitate analysis
3. Include plotting graphs

## Installation

You can install the latest release of JirAgileR from [Github](https://github.com/matbmeijer/JirAgileR) with the following commands in R:

``` r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("matbmeijer/JirAgileR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to obtain a simple table of issues of a project and create a tabular report. You will need a username and your password to authenticate in your domain. Possible fields to obtain (which will populate the `data.frame` columns) can be found [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/issue-fields-and-statuses-802592413.html).

``` {r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(JirAgileR, quietly = T)
library(knitr, quietly = T)

Domain <- "https://bitvoodoo.atlassian.net"
JQL_query <- "project='CONGRATS'"
Search_field <- c("summary","created", "status")
# Other possible fields are for example c("project", "key", "type", "priority", "resolution", "labels", "description", "links")

df<-JiraQuery2R(domain = Domain, query = JQL_query, fields = Search_field)

kable(df, row.names = F, padding = 0)

```

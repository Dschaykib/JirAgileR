The objective of **JirAgileR** is to bring the power of the project management tool **JIRA** to **R**. By doing so, users benefit from the best capabilities of both platforms. More specifically, the package is a wrapper around JIRA's REST API, allowing users to analyze JIRA's extracted data in R.  

**Current Functionalities:**

* Extract all projects with its basic information (e.g. Name, ID, Key, Type, Category etc.)
* Extract all issues spefic to user defined JIRA query (it allows to expand both JIRA's default fields as well as user defined custom JIRA fields)

Roadmap:


Instead of building a diferent class object to facilitate the analysis within R a regular `data.frame` is returned. In future the objective is to integrate visualization options and exports as pdf slides and/or .pptx slide. Other options are to come.

## Installation

You can install the latest release of JirAgileR from [Github](https://github.com/matbmeijer/JirAgileR) with the following commands in R:

``` r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("matbmeijer/JirAgileR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to obtain a simple table of issues of a project and create a tabular report in CSV format. You will need a username and your password to authenticate in your domain:

``` {r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(JirAgileR)

Domain <- "https://bitvoodoo.atlassian.net"
JQL_query <- "project='CONGRATS'"
Search_field <- c("summary","created", "reporter")

df<-JiraQuery2R(domain = Domain, query = JQL_query, fields = Search_field)

library(knitr)
kable(df, caption = "CONGRATS status")
```
